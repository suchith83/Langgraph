Subject: Unable to Attend the Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope you're well.

I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to make it to the meeting scheduled for 10:00 AM at Canary Wharf. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, I would be available at 12:00 PM in New York the next day if you are able to reschedule or if you would like to catch up then.

Please let me know if there's anything important that I miss or if I can catch up with you afterwards.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Suchith
