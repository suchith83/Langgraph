Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting Tomorrow

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to let you know that I am unable to attend the meeting at Canary Wharf tomorrow at 10:00 AM. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, I will be available the next day at 12:00 PM in New York if that works for you. Please let me know if we can reschedule for that time, or if there's anything I should prepare or share in advance.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Suchith
