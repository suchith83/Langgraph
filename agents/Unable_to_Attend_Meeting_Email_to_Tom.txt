Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to let you know that I am unable to make it to the meeting scheduled for 10AM at the wharf. My apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, I am available to meet at 12:00 PM in New York the next day if that works for you.

Please let me know if there is anything I should catch up on or if we can reschedule.

Best regards,

Steve
